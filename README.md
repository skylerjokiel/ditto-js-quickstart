[https://portal.ditto.live/dql-editor/YOUR-APP-ID](https://portal.ditto.live/dql-editor/YOUR-APP-ID)

> ℹ️ Ditto's web application only support real-time collaboration through the Ditto cloud (Big Peer) and not direct peer-to-peer collaboration. This is due to limitation in system access that browsers provide.

## App Overview
The `Generate Color` button will add a new `color` document to our `colors` collection and display in a list along side. Deleting a color will mark the `isDeleted` flag to true and it will be filtered from the view.

## Data Modeling

Documents are stored in the `colors` collection.

Document in the `colors` collection have the following schema:
```js
{
    _id: string // uuid auto generated by Ditto
    color: string // hex value
    isDeleted: boolean // denotes if the color was deleted (default false)
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If your app is working but not syncing data these are common errors you might find in the console.

### Invalid App ID
> Uncaught (in promise) Error: Provided App ID was not a valid UUID
    at dittoIdentityConfigMakeOnlinePlayground (ditto.es6.js:1:78162)
    at ditto.es6.js:1:194788
    at new Ditto (ditto.es6.js:1:195096)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:14:11)

If you see the above message it means that your provided Ditto AppID was invalid. Make sure to follow step 4 in the Getting Started section.

### Invalid Token
> POST https://YOUR-APP-ID.cloud.ditto.live/_ditto/auth/login 401 (Unauthorized)

If you see the above message it means that your App ID is valid but the token your provided is invalid. Double check to make sure you have the correct App ID and Playground Token from the Ditto Portal.
